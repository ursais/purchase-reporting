Overview
========
This module adds the ability to view UIGR and Backordered products on Purchase Oders.
The quantity and the value of both UIGR and Backordered products is computed for
purcahse order lines and then aggregated for display on the parent purchase order.

Usage
=====
Install the module. In the purchase module, under the Purcahse menu, select the 
PO Backorders menu option. This will display a tree view of all purchase order lines
with their UIGR and Backorder information as well as the last date received and the
last date billed. Select one or more items in the tree view and then select the 
PO Backorder Report option from the Print menu to print a report of the selected items.
